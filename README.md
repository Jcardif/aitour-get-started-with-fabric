# Get started with Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric

This repo is intended as a template for Microsoft AI Tour repositories

## Session Desciption

Analysis of real-time data streams is a critical capability for any modern data analytics solution. You can use the Real-Time Intelligence capabilities of Microsoft Fabric to ingest, query, and process streams of data.

## Learning Outcomes

The sample data you'll use in this lab is a set of bicycle data, containing information about bike ID, location, timestamp, and more. You'll learn how to set up resources, ingest data, set alerts on the data, and visualize the data to extract insights.

In this lab you will learn how to:
- Set up your environment
- Get data in the Real-Time hub
- Transform events
- Publish an event stream
- Set an alert on the event stream
- Create a KQL query
- Create a Real-Time dashboard
- Explore data visually in the Real-Time dashboard
- Create a Power BI report from a KQL query

## Technology Used

- Microsoft Fabric
- Real-Time Intelligence
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
